# Classes and workshops
## A repository of code for classes and other examples in R
### University of Florida, Plant Pathology

I participated as a Teaching Assistant (TA) in courses of network analysis, epidemiology and data sciences, also I have taught in workshops imparted by the @[GarrettLab](https://www.garrettlab.com/), and [CABANA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/events/2020/cabana-workshop-ngs-analysis-applied-virome-sequencing-agricultural-systems).

The code was generated as a collaborative effort by members of the Garret lab, with contributions in different part of the code and datasets.
